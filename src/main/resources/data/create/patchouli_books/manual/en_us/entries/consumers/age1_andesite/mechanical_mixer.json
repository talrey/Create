      "text": "the Mixer works with a Basin in much the same way a Press does. It's capable of scattering a compressed material, or blending components into a smooth mixture. The Mixer does require a certain minimum speed to make the whisk effective, so study the $(l:introduction/3_overview_trans)tactics of transmission$() if it won't run. Or, you know, turn off that redstone signal you applied to it specifically to stop it from running."
